### ✨ [Demo](https://github.com/dunivers3/password-generator-app)

### How it's made:

> <strong>Tech used: </strong> HTML, CSS, Javascript. </br>
> While there are many examples of "random" password generator programs available on the Internet, generating randomness can be tricky and many programs do not generate random characters in a way that ensures strong security. This software is made with randomness in mind which interprets to a strong security.
> The software integrates javascript methods to generate keys that are non-repeatable.

## Optimizations:

-   Make user able to highlight, copy to clipboard and edit password(text) with a single click.
-   Populate the random passwords with different colors and different background to help with user choice.
-   Generate different password lengths on each password build.

## Lessons learnt:

> The simplest automizations will increase productivity.
> Painting the DOM each and every time the app loads consumes more resources. Dom should be painted less with each reload.

## Install
